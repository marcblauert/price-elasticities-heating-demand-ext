## Short-Term Price Elasticities of Heating Demand: <br/> A Statistical Analysis of Energy Billing Data in Germany

### Short Project Description

Investigation of short-term price elasticities of space heating demand in Germany based on an empirical data set of heating energy bills at the building-level. On average 260,000 multi-apartment buildings are observsed annually (no single-family homes). Time period between 2008 and 2019 is investigated. Use of fixed effects models on full sample and Bayesian multilevel models on sub-sample of the data.

### Organisational Aspects
