## Short-Term Price Elasticities of Heating Demand: <br/> A Statistical Analysis of Energy Billing Data in Germany

### Short Project Description

Investigation of short-term price elasticities of space heating demand in Germany based on an empirical dataset of energy bills at the building level. The time period between 2008 and 2019 is investigated with a total of almost 2.8 million observations. Use of fixed-effects models on the full sample and Bayesian multilevel partial pooling models on a subsample of the data. Besides overall price elasticities, also the heterogeneity in price responsiveness is investigated.

### Organisational Aspects

Master thesis written in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science (MSc) in the Integrated Natural Resource Management (INRM) Program at Humboldt University of Berlin. Thesis written in collaboration with the Climate Policy Department at DIW Berlin. The energy billing data used for the analysis is provided by DIW Berlin.
